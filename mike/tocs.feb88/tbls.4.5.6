Copy a directory hierarchy containing 70
files and 200 kbytes of data;  examine the
status of every file in the new subtree; read
every byte of the files;  compile and link
the files.  Developed by M. Satyanarayanan
for benchmarking the Andrew file system;

\fBTable 6\fR.  Execution times with and without local disks
and caching, measured on Sun-3's.  The top number
for each run is total elapsed time in seconds.  The
bottom number is normalized relative to the warm-start time with
a local disk.  ``Cold'' means that all caches, both on server and
client, were empty at the beginning of the run.  ``Warm'' means
that the program was run once to load the caches, then timed on a
second run.  In the ``Diskless, Server Cache Only'' case, the client
cache was disabled but the server cache was still enabled.  In
all other cases, caches were enabled on all machines.  All caches
were allowed to vary in size using the VM-FS negotiation scheme.
