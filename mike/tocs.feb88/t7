\fBTable 7\fR.  Comparison of file systems.  All of the systems but
Apollo, Cedar and Sprite are variants of the UNIX operating system.
The Apollo system delineates active use of a file by lock and unlock
instead of open and close. The Cedar File System (CFS) only caches
immutable files and provides a different type of cache consistency than
the other systems.  SModel is a software tool that is used to move cached
files that have been changed back to their file server.
