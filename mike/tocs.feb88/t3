\fBTable 3\fR. Cost of three common file name lookup operations in Sprite.
Each of these operations requires contacting the server of the named file.
Times are milliseconds per operation on a pathname with a single component.
The first row is the cost of opening and closing a file,
the second row is the cost of opening a file that does not exist,
and the third row is the cost of getting the attributes of a file (``stat'').
