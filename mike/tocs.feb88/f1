\fBFigure 1.\fR  File caches in the Sprite system.  When a process
makes a file access, it is presented first to the cache of the process's
workstation (``file traffic'').  If not satisfied there, the request
is passed either to the local disk, if the file is stored there
(``disk traffic''), or to the server where the file is stored
(``server traffic'').  Servers
also maintain caches in order to reduce their disk traffic.
