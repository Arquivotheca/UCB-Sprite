\fBFigure 2\fR. Client degradation and network traffic (diskless Sun-3's with
client caches, warm start) as a function of maximum client
cache size. For each point, the maximum size of the client cache
was limited to a particular value. 
The ``degradation'' shown in (a) is relative
to the time required to execute the benchmark with a local disk and
warm cache.  
The network traffic shown in (b) includes bytes transmitted in packet 
headers and control packets, as well as file data.
The diff benchmark did not fit on graph (b);
for all cache sizes less than 2 Mbytes it has an I/O rate of 185 Kbytes/second
and for all larger cache sizes it has an I/O rate of only 0.5 Kbytes/second.
