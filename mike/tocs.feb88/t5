Andrew;T{
Copy a directory hierarchy containing 70
files and 200 Kbytes of data;  examine the
status of every file in the new subtree; read
every byte of the files;  compile and link
the files.  Developed by M. Satyanarayanan
for benchmarking the Andrew file system;
see [HOWA87] for details.

\fBTable 5\fR.  Macro-benchmarks.  The I/O columns give the
average rates at which file data were read and written by the
benchmark when run on Sun-3's with local disks and warm caches;  they measure
the benchmark's I/O intensity.
