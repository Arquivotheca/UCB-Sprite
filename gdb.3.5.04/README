These sources are based on the gdb 3.5.01 that was done for Mach 2.5.
They have been hacked by a variety of people for use with Mach 3.0.

The current sources know about local changes done by the
Sprite-on-Mach project.  In particular, we have a private version of
CThreads that includes the thread-local data support from the US
(multi-server) CThreads package.  Theoretically you can replace our
cthreads.h with a vanilla MK cthreads.h and gdb will not care.

Version 3.5.04 has the following features:
- Fixed a bug in the mips-specific code that would truncate stack
  backtraces if you looked at multiple threads.

Version 3.5.03 has the following features:
- Improved support for DECstations (e.g., smarter about nested C
  source files, able to translate MIPS exception codes to text strings).
- Uses the GNU malloc.

Version 3.5.02 has the following noteworthy features:
- Better support for Mach 3.0: handles SIGINT and its handling of the
  debuggee is much more robust (from OSF Grenoble).
- Printing of Mach 3.0 CThread names is partially supported.  (The
  main requirement is that the C Thread must be wired to a kernel
  thread.)
