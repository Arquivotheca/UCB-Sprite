This directory contains code and documentation for Nachos,
a course project for teaching undergraduate operating systems.

The text describing the assignments is in the sub-directory "doc"; 
the code itself is in "code".

We are in the process of revising both the code and the assignments
to reflect feedback from using Nachos during the past semester.
As a result, this directory reflects a snapshot of Nachos as of
July 20, 1992.
