  \caption{Times to complete sequences of system calls.
    For each benchmark, times are given for the
  program running on locally on a diskless Sun-3 workstation and
  migrated from one diskless Sun-3 to another.  For these sequences
  of system calls, the overhead of
  remote execution is substantial.}
