For IEEE conference proceedings.

Most of the file names are self-explanatory.

title.tex: 	for the title. Should be in upper-case.

author.tex: 	the author(s).

abstract.tex:	surprisingly enough, the abstract. The length is
		limited.

text.tex:	example of basic text.
text_format.tex:format for the above. Half an IEEE column. One page is
		two columns. For the future, I suggest we input
		AppleWriter papers long enough to contain a whole IEEE
		page. We just need another, larger feeder than the
		standard one, and the corresponding paper.
	
table.tex:	nothing really special except the format. For tables.
table_format.tex:format for having two column tables eating only half
		of the column height (half of an IEEE page). It is
		suggested to place the tables at the top of a page (or
		at the bottom) rather than at the middle.
