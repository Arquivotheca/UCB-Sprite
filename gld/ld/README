This linker is the Gnu linker with some modifications that allow it
to be used as a cross-linker between different machine types.

You can change the target machine by defining `TARGET_MACHINE' in the
Makefile.  If you do not define a TARGET_MACHINE it will default to
the same as the host machine.

It has been tested for the following hosts and targets:

Host		Target          OS
sun4		sun3,sun4	sunOS, sprite
sun3		sun3,sun4	sunOS, sprite
ds3100		sun3,sun4	sprite

If you have any problems or questions, please send email to

If you successfully use this linker on systems other than those listed
above, please let me know.
