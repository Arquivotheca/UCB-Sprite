Mipsim

by John Ousterhout

Mipsim is a simulator+debugger for the MIPS R2000 architecture.  It
reads assembly-language files and simulates the execution of those
files on an R2000 machine under the control of an interactive command
language.

To generate an executable version of Mipsim, type "make" in this directory.

There are two forms of documentation available for Mipsim:  a terse
man page and a longer tutorial document.  To print the man page, type

		ditroff mipsim.man

or whatever the equivalent command is in your system.  Do not provide
any macros to the command.  To print the tutorial document you'll need
to have the program "grn" (which is used on Gremlin files).   If your
site has that program, then the formatting command is

		grn manual.me | ditroff -me

If you don't have the "grn" program (and you probably don't), there is
a Postscript file manual.ps that you can print as-is.

I can't promise any support for Mipsim, but I'm still interested in hearing
about bugs or suggestions for improvement.  Send these to me at
"ouster@sprite.berkeley.edu".
